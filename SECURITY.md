# Security Headers Implementation

This website implements comprehensive security headers to protect against various web vulnerabilities.

## Implemented Security Headers

### 1. Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- **Purpose**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded
- **Implementation**: Restricts sources to trusted domains only
- **Allowed Sources**:
  - Scripts: Self, CDN (EmailJS, FontAwesome)
  - Styles: Self, Google Fonts, CDN
  - Images: Self, data URIs, HTTPS sources
  - Connections: Self, EmailJS API

### 2. X-Frame-Options
- **Purpose**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Value**: `SAMEORIGIN` - allows framing only from same origin
- **Protection**: Stops malicious sites from embedding your site in iframes

### 3. X-Content-Type-Options
- **Purpose**: Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks
- **Value**: `nosniff` - forces browser to respect declared content types
- **Protection**: Prevents execution of malicious content disguised as safe files

### 4. Referrer-Policy
- **Purpose**: Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests
- **Value**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **Protection**: Limits information leakage to external sites

### 5. Permissions-Policy
- **Purpose**: Controls browser features and APIs
- **Restrictions**: 
  - Geolocation: Disabled
  - Microphone: Disabled
  - Camera: Disabled
  - Payment: Disabled
  - Fullscreen: Same origin only

### 6. Additional Security Headers

#### X-XSS-Protection (Legacy Support)
- **Value**: `1; mode=block`
- **Purpose**: Enables XSS filtering in older browsers

#### Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS Only)
- **Value**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- **Purpose**: Enforces HTTPS connections

## Implementation Methods

### 1. Meta Tags (src/index.html)
- Basic implementation using HTML meta tags
- Works on all hosting platforms
- Limited effectiveness compared to HTTP headers

### 2. Apache (.htaccess)
- For Apache web servers
- Full HTTP header implementation
- Includes caching and compression optimizations

### 3. Netlify/Vercel (_headers)
- For modern hosting platforms
- Proper HTTP header implementation
- Includes cache control directives

### 4. Vercel (vercel.json)
- Specific configuration for Vercel deployment
- Includes routing and header rules
- Production-ready setup

## Security Testing

You can test the implemented security headers using:

1. **Security Headers Checker**: https://securityheaders.com/
2. **Mozilla Observatory**: https://observatory.mozilla.org/
3. **CSP Evaluator**: https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/

## Maintenance

- Review and update CSP directives when adding new external resources
- Test headers after any hosting platform changes
- Monitor for new security recommendations and update accordingly

## Compliance

These headers help meet security requirements for:
- OWASP security guidelines
- Industry security standards
- Client security assessments
- Cybersecurity best practices
