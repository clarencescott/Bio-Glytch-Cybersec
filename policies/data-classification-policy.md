#  Data Classification Policy

## Purpose

To establish a framework for classifying and handling organizational data based on its sensitivity, value, and regulatory requirements. This ensures appropriate protection, access control, and compliance.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who create, access, store, or transmit company data across any medium or system.

## Classification Levels

All data must be classified into one of the following categories:

### 1. **Public**
- Intended for public release
- Minimal risk if disclosed
- Examples: marketing materials, job postings, press releases

### 2. **Internal**
- Intended for internal use only
- Moderate risk if disclosed
- Examples: internal emails, operational procedures, meeting notes

### 3. **Confidential**
- Sensitive business or personal data
- High risk if disclosed or altered
- Examples: customer records, financial reports, employee evaluations

### 4. **Restricted**
- Critical or regulated data requiring the highest level of protection
- Severe impact if compromised
- Examples: health records, payment card data, trade secrets, credentials

## Handling Requirements

| Internal       | Role-based     | Encryption recommended | Secure systems | Secure deletion |
| Confidential   | Need-to-know   | Encrypted     | Encrypted & access-logged | Shredding or secure wipe |
