#  Access Control Policy

## Purpose

To define the principles and procedures for granting, managing, and revoking access to systems, applications, and data in order to minimize risk and enforce the principle of least privilege.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and third-party users who require access to company systems, networks, or data.

## Policy

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Access must be granted based on job function and business need.
- Roles should be clearly defined and documented.
- Users must only be assigned to roles necessary for their responsibilities.

### 2. Least Privilege
- Users must be given the minimum level of access required to perform their duties.
- Elevated privileges (e.g., admin rights) must be tightly controlled and monitored.

### 3. Access Requests & Approvals
- All access requests must be submitted through an approved system.
- Requests must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate manager or data owner.
- Temporary access must have a defined expiration date.

### 4. Authentication
- All access must require secure authentication (e.g., passwords, MFA).
- Privileged accounts must use multi-factor authentication (MFA) at all times.

### 5. Account Management
- Accounts must be disabled or removed immediately upon termination or role change.
- Shared accounts are prohibited unless explicitly approved and monitored.
- Periodic reviews of user accounts must be conducted at least quarterly.

### 6. Logging & Monitoring
- Access to sensitive systems and data must be logged.
- Logs must be reviewed regularly for unauthorized access attempts.

### 7. Third-Party Access
- Vendors and contractors must follow the same access control standards.
- Third-party access must be time-bound and monitored.

## Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination of access, employment, or legal action.

## Review

This policy will be reviewed annually or upon significant changes to systems, roles, or regulatory requirements.
