# Incident Response Policy

## Purpose

To establish a structured approach for identifying, managing, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of organizational assets.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party partners who may detect, report, or respond to security incidents involving company systems, data, or infrastructure.

## Definitions

- **Security Incident**: Any attempted or actual unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information.
- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: A designated group responsible for managing and resolving security incidents.

## Policy

### 1. Incident Categories

Incidents are classified into the following categories:
- **Unauthorized Access** – Breach of user accounts or systems
- **Malware Infection** – Viruses, ransomware, or spyware
- **Data Breach** – Exposure or theft of sensitive data
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Disruption of services or systems
- **Insider Threat** – Malicious or negligent actions by internal users

### 2. Detection & Reporting

- All users must report suspected incidents immediately via the designated reporting channel (e.g., security@company.com).
- Automated monitoring systems must be in place to detect anomalies and alert the IRT.

### 3. Response Phases

#### a. Identification
- Confirm the incident and determine its scope and impact.

#### b. Containment

- Apply temporary fixes or access restrictions.

#### c. Eradication

#### d. Recovery
- Restore systems to normal operation.
- Monitor for signs of recurrence.

#### e. Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident review.
- Update policies, procedures, and training as needed.

### 4. Communication

- Internal stakeholders must be informed promptly.
- External communication (e.g., regulators, customers, media) must be coordinated through legal and PR teams.
- Maintain confidentiality and avoid speculation.

### 5. Documentation

- All incidents must be logged with timestamps, actions taken, and outcomes.
- Reports must be retained for audit and compliance purposes.

## Enforcement
